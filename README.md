Jupyter Notebooks and Presentations from Digital Image Processing Course that I took on 2018 during my Graduate Studies.


In this course, basic topics about image processing were addressed, such as histograms, spatial and intensity trasnformations, filters, fourier transforms, and segmentation. The proposed exercises were programmed in Python, with the use of libraries such OpenCV and scikit-image. A seminar about image sharpening was also presented and a final project was made, about the developing of an algorithm for piano keys recognition during the playback of a video.
